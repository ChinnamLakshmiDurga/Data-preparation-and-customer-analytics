## Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program_Task-1
### Description:
Being a part of Quantiumâ€™s retail analytics team and we have been approached by a client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.The insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarketâ€™s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.
### Overall outline of the task:    
ðŸŽ¯ **Examine transaction data** â€“ Look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If determined any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to our analysis. 

ðŸŽ¯ **Examine customer data** â€“ Check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and merge the transaction and customer data together so itâ€™s ready for the analysis ensuring you save our files along the way.

ðŸŽ¯ **Data analysis and customer segments** â€“ In our analysis we need to make sureto  define the metrics â€“ look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights we find. These will all form part of our report. 

ðŸŽ¯ **Deep dive into customer segments** â€“ Defining our recommendation from our insights, determining which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on our analysis.
